Description: Allows Bayesian borrowing from a historical dataset for time-to-
    event data. A flexible baseline hazard function is achieved via a piecewise
    exponential likelihood with time varying split points and smoothing prior on the
    historic baseline hazards. The method is described in Scott and Lewin (2024) 
    <arXiv:2401.06082>.
